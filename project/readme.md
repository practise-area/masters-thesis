# Master's Thesis / Project

This directory contains the source code for my master's thesis project.  
The project is written in C# and utilizes both [Mono.Cecil][cecil] and [PostSharp][postsharp].

The solution consists of three separate projects.

```
regression.core -- the implementation of a regression testing technique.
project.core -- example application used for evaluation in the report.
project.core.test -- unit tests for the application and NUnit addin.
```
